# zx-cron-boilerplate

node.js zx boilerplate.

Goals:

- Cron Job oriented
- Fastest installation possible
- Multithreaded & parallellism by default
- One shot jobs (checkout + cache + install + run) should run ~ 5 seconds.
- Avoid expensive apt-get update. Rely on static upx compressed binaries
- Super productive & fast boilerplate environment using [zx](https://github.com/google/zx) shen needed
