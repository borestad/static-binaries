  "body": "Upgrade to 2.3.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeno upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr install for the first time\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- #29172 feat: **Support \"unconfigured\" runtime in `deno serve`.** Allows `deno serve` to run even when no project configuration is present (an “unconfigured” runtime). Previously `deno serve` required a config file or project context; now it works in any directory. This makes quick serving of files or directories easier without extra setup.\r\n- #29154 feat(ext/fetch): **Add support for fetch on unix sockets**. Enables using the Fetch API over Unix domain sockets by passing an appropriate `Deno.HttpClient` with socket-based endpoints:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst client = Deno.createHttpClient({\r\n  proxy: {\r\n    transport: \"unix\",\r\n    path: \"/path/to/unix.sock\",\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\nawait fetch(\"http://localhost/ping\", { client });\r\n```\r\n\r\n- #29287 feat(otel): **Add events for `boot_failure` and `uncaught_exception` for OTel**. Emits two new OpenTelemetry events, `boot_failure` and `uncaught_exception`, when a worker crashes at startup or due to an exception. These signals enrich telemetry data by marking failure scenarios, helping developers and SREs more easily diagnose crashes and monitor Deno processes.\r\n- #27740 feat(ext/fetch): **Support custom DNS resolver**. Introduces a new `Resolve` trait and `Resolver` variant so that fetch can use a custom DNS resolver implementation. This gives developers fine-grained control over hostname resolution (e.g. for caching or proxy rules), making network requests more adaptable to specific environments.\r\n- #29267 feat(coverage): **Adds dark mode to HTML coverage report**. Adds `color-scheme: light dark` support to the HTML coverage report, automatically adjusting text and background colors for dark theme users. Developers working in dark mode environments will see coverage results styled appropriately, improving readability and consistency.\r\n- #29249 feat(jupyter): **Allow `deno jupyter` to install and maintain multiple kernels**. Enhances `deno jupyter` by adding a `--name` flag (and optional `--display`) to install multiple named kernelspecs (e.g. stable vs canary). The installer now checks for existing kernels and can force-overwrite, preventing accidental conflicts. These options give developers greater control over Jupyter kernel setup and naming conventions.\r\n- #29244 feat(lsp): **Add new `TaskDefinition` description field to LSP**. Adds a description field to the LSP `TaskDefinition` for Deno tasks. Editors can now show human-readable labels for tasks, helping developers understand task purposes (e.g. “Run Deno test suite”) when choosing or running tasks in the IDE.\r\n- #29173 feat(unstable): **Notify control sock on serving**. Implements sending a notification over the Deno control socket when `Deno.serve` starts listening for requests. This allows external tools or scripts to detect exactly when the server is ready to accept connections, improving integration (e.g. automated testing or orchestration) by providing a clear “server ready” event.\r\n- #29189 feat(unstable): **Support comments in lint plugin**. Exposes source comments to the lint plugin API by adding a comments field to the program AST node and helper methods like `getAllComments()`. Lint rule authors can now inspect or report on comments, making it easier to write rules that depend on annotated comments (e.g. custom suppression or documentation checks).\r\n- #29296 feat: **Add support for `DENO_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` env var**. Introduces the `DENO_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` environment variable, which tells Deno to strip incoming `x-deno-client-address` headers from HTTP requests. This prevents IP spoofing via proxy headers, improving security by ensuring only trusted proxies can override client address.\r\n- #29109 feat: **`DENO_SERVE_ADDRESS` duplicate option**. Extends the `DENO_SERVE_ADDRESS` JSON to allow a \"duplicate\" field. If provided, Deno will spawn a second listener on that address instead of replacing the existing one. This lets developers (or tools) set up additional server sockets without losing the user’s original address settings.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n- #29162 perf(lsp): Improves LSP formatting speed by skipping the expensive “diff” step on huge files. Files over 10,000 lines are now formatted without computing a full diff, avoiding excessive CPU work or timeouts on very large documents.\r\n- #29192 perf(lsp): Speeds up the Language Server by not loading JSON files over 10 MB in full. Large JSON files are truncated (partial parse) to prevent using too much memory and CPU, greatly improving responsiveness when editing or importing very large JSON data.\r\n- #29137 perf(npm): Offloads the JSON deserialization of cached npm registry “packuments” to a background blocking task. This means the main thread isn’t held up deserializing large package metadata, making npm-related operations (like deno cache for npm packages) faster and more responsive.\r\n- #27935 perf(publish): Enhances `deno publish` by retrieving statuses of multiple npm packages concurrently instead of sequentially. This parallelization significantly reduces the time to check publish status for many packages, speeding up the overall publish process.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- fix(cache): added support for the --env-file flag ([#29160](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/29160))\r\n- fix(check): do not add `@types/node@*` to lockfile if a `@types/node` req\r\n- already exists
