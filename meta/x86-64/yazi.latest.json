  "body": "## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- `[manager]` is deprecated in favor of the new `[mgr]`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2803\r\n- `tab_width` has been removed as it no longer needs to be set manually. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2745\r\n- `tab_active` and `tab_inactive` are moved under the new `[tabs]` section. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2745\r\n- `sixel_fraction` has been removed as it's no longer needed. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2707\r\n\r\n## Deprecated\r\n\r\n- `ya.mgr_emit()`, `ya.app_emit()` and `ya.input_emit()` are deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2653\r\n- `ya.preview_widgets()` is deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2706\r\n- `Command:args()` is deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2752\r\n- The `ya pack` subcommand is deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2770\r\n- `LEFT`, `CENTER`, `RIGHT` on `ui.Line`, `ui.Text` are deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2802\r\n- `NONE`, `TOP`, `RIGHT`, `BOTTOM`, `LEFT`, `ALL` on `ui.Bar`, `ui.Border` are deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2802\r\n- `WRAP_NO`, `WRAP`, `WRAP_TRIM` on `ui.Text` are deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2802\r\n\r\n## Redesign Tabs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2745 decouples tabs from the header into an independent tab bar component to enhance UX:\r\n\r\n- A standalone single-line component increases the available space for displaying tabs.\r\n- Tab titles are displayed by default to increase recognizability.\r\n- Supports switching tabs via mouse for easier navigation.\r\n\r\nThe new tab bar is only shown when there is more than one tab, ensuring no space is wasted for users who don't use tabs.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ca33561-7558-4b9c-8b6a-9dfbc0bc8aa4\r\n\r\n## Calculate Real-Time Directory Size in Spotter\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2695 adds directory sizes to the `folder` spotter. The size is computed dynamically in real time and asynchronously, which means:\r\n\r\n- Every time a user clicks `<Tab>` on a directory, the latest size is calculated.\r\n- For large directories, real-time changes in size are reported to the user, with \"(?)\" appended at the end to indicate that the calculation is in progress.\r\n- If the user closes the spotter or switches directories using the left/right arrow keys, any ongoing calculations will be canceled to avoid wasting resources.\r\n\r\nAlso, the computed directory size will be updated in the file list:\r\n\r\n- If the user sets `linemode = size`, the latest size will be shown on the right of the file line.\r\n- If the user sets `sort_by = size`, the file list will be sorted by the latest sizes (if necessary).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2981e6-3e02-4997-abfc-83cc456a1677\r\n\r\n## 9x Faster Sixel Image Preview\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2707 replaces the existing neural network quantization algorithm with Wu's Color Quantizer, which offers [better performance](https://github.com/Ivordir/quantette/blob/main/docs/Benchmarks%20and%20Accuracy.md#time) while [maintaining comparable quality](https://github.com/Ivordir/quantette/blob/main/docs/Benchmarks%20and%20Accuracy.md#accuracydssim).\r\n\r\nOld implementation (neural network via [`color_quant`](https://github.com/image-rs/color_quant), with default `sixel_fraction = 20`) – average 189.5763999ms:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntime: 190.025ms\r\ntime: 191.054417ms\r\ntime: 187.696792ms\r\ntime: 188.060791ms\r\ntime: 189.381958ms\r\ntime: 191.618042ms\r\ntime: 192.383125ms\r\ntime: 190.511291ms\r\ntime: 187.8395ms\r\ntime: 187.193083ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew implementation (Wu - sRGB via [`quantette`](https://github.com/Ivordir/quantette)) – average 20.9199916ms:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntime: 21.226458ms\r\ntime: 20.719542ms\r\ntime: 21.207583ms\r\ntime: 20.815875ms\r\ntime: 21.071291ms\r\ntime: 21.273459ms\r\ntime: 20.811792ms\r\ntime: 20.723166ms\r\ntime: 20.52675ms\r\ntime: 20.824ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## [`piper.yazi` Plugin](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/piper.yazi)\r\n\r\nWith [`piper.yazi`](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/piper.yazi), you can use the output of any shell command as preview content. This eliminates the need to write a separate plugin for each command, making the use of custom previewers much more convenient.\r\n\r\n![screenshot-002418](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59618aed-fa80-46e6-a6fc-82918317e9c2)\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/piper.yazi#examples for more examples!\r\n\r\n## Double Directory Size Calculation Speed\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2683 greatly improves directory computation performance by dividing the task into chunks and reusing existing threads. Directory sorting and file trashing will be observably twice as fast.\r\n\r\nRun the benchmark script against a 10.16GB folder 5 times in release mode:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nOld: elapsed 759.877791ms\r\nNew: elapsed 364.802583ms\r\n\r\nOld: elapsed 734.5155ms\r\nNew: elapsed 360.103375ms\r\n\r\nOld: elapsed 734.124167ms\r\nNew: elapsed 365.662458ms\r\n\r\nOld: elapsed 733.27325ms\r\nNew: elapsed 365.694042ms\r\n\r\nOld: elapsed 743.394875ms\r\nNew: elapsed 364.455083ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Input Component Now Supports Password Mode\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2675, a new `obscure = true` option is available:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal value = ya.input {\r\n  title = \"Password:\",\r\n  obscure = true,\r\n  position = { \"center\", w = 50 },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff5b21f2-977b-4e9f-a279-e4cb15b51a57\r\n\r\n## Truncate Long Items in the File List\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2754, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2759, and https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2778 add truncation support for long filenames in the file list and archive preview, and display file extensions at the end, ensuring that even if a filename is truncated, you can still know what file type it is by its extension.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f1afbdb-17ec-410f-adea-e8b1d2ed6341\r\n\r\n## [`types.yazi` Plugin](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/types.yazi)\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Yazi lacked a type definition file, which made plugin development very painful. Now, it's here!\r\n\r\n[`types.yazi`](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/types.yazi) provides type definitions for Yazi's Lua API, empowering an efficient plugin development experience.\r\n\r\n## Improved Built-In Previewers\r\n\r\n- The `video` previewer now supports displaying embedded video covers, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2640\r\n- The `magick` previewer will respect the user's `image_alloc` and `image_bound` settings, to limit its maximum resource usage, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2602, thanks to @ze0987\r\n- The `video` previewer will respect the user's `max_width` setting, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2560, thanks to @ze0987\r\n\r\n## Improve Path Auto-Completion Results\r\n\r\nThe auto-completion results for interactive cd (key: `g` => `<Space>`) will now more closely match the user's input keywords. \r\n\r\nDone in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2765\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix: reverse the mixing order of theme and flavor configuration by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2594\r\n* feat: limit memory usage for previewing large images by @ze0987 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2602\r\n* fix: respect the user's `max_width` setting for the built-in video previewer by @ze0987 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2560\r\n* feat: allow custom exit code with `quit --code` by @Nicholas42 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2609\r\n* fix: ensure state synchronization even when the package update fails midway by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2613\r\n* fix: do not change revision when package deployment fails by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2627\r\n* feat: copy-on-write support for field caching by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2629\r\n* feat: fall back to `CSI 16 t` when PowerShell OpenSSH returns a fake terminal size by @sxyazi in
