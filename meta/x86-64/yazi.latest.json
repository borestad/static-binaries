  "body": "## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Supported wraparound navigation and enabled it by default. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2485\r\n- Replaced `tasks_show` and `close_input` with `tasks:show` and `input:close`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2530\r\n- `frag`, `name`, `stem`, `ext`, and `parent` on [`Url`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/types#shared.url), `name` on [`tab::Tab`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/types#app-data.tab-tab), and `is_hovered` on [`fs::File`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/types#app-data.fs-file) are now properties. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2572\r\n- Swapped the default key bindings for `z` (zoxide) and `Z` (fzf). https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/2546\r\n- Used the new `@sync peek` annotation instead of the previewer's `sync = true`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2487\r\n\r\n## Deprecated\r\n\r\n- `ui.Padding` and `ui.Rect:padding()` are deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2574\r\n\r\n## Packaging\r\n\r\n- SVG preview backend switched from ImageMagick to [`resvg`](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) and implemented as a new `svg` previewer. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2581\r\n\r\n## Custom Search Engine Lua API\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2452, you can create custom search engines via the Lua API, meaning that plugins can serve as the source for search view file lists.\r\n\r\nA new plugin [vcs-files.yazi](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/vcs-files.yazi) is available to display the list of files changed in Git within Yazi:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6f7d55-002b-4933-b8e8-41f335b96a2b\r\n\r\n## Platform-Specific Key Binding\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2526 adds a new *optional* `for` field to key bindings to specify the platform the key binding applies to.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n{ on = [ 'g', 'd' ], run = 'cd ~/dev',  desc = 'Go dev',    for = 'unix' },\r\n{ on = [ 'g', 'd' ], run = 'cd C:\\dev', desc = 'Go C:\\dev', for = 'windows' },\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Performance Improvements\r\n\r\nThis version brings several performance enhancements:\r\n\r\n- Configuration parser has been rewritten to double the startup speed. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2508\r\n- AVIF, HEIF, and JPEG XL previews have seen significant performance improvements. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533, thanks @ze0987\r\n- Compiled and cached the Lua bytecode to enhance the overall performance of the plugin system. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2490\r\n\r\n## Enhance `fzf` Integration\r\n\r\nNow, you can select multiple files in `fzf`, and the selected files will also be selected in Yazi.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can now view, navigate, and deselect the file selection list from Yazi within `fzf`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7b175a3-fa73-4128-8239-f90e45f13ab3\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/2546 for more details.\r\n\r\n## Use Yazi File Manager Directly in Helix, Without Zellij or tmux\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2461 adapted Yazi to support Helix's `:insert-output`, which means you can now run Yazi directly within Helix – it even supports image and video previews!\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dbf7aca-fc4e-4f9e-b554-70cadedf0484\r\n\r\n## New `prev` and `next` Arguments to `arrow` for Wraparound Navigation\r\n\r\nCircular navigation is one of the long-requested features, and is now supported via the new `arrow prev` and `arrow next` commands in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2485.\r\n\r\n## New `follow` Command to Follow Files Pointed to by Symlinks\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2543 adds support for following files pointed to by symlinks.\r\n\r\nA new key binding, `g` => `f` (follow hovered symlink), has been added to use this feature.\r\n\r\n## Allow Initializing Input When Opening It with Commands Like `rename`, `create`, `find`, `filter`, etc.\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2578, you can now customize the input box opened by commands such as `create`, `rename`, `cd`, `filter`, `find`, `search`, and `shell`. For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n{ on = \"r\", run = [ \"rename\", \"input:escape\" ] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will open the rename input box and exit insert mode, meaning that the default state will be normal mode.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* feat: new `<C-A>` and `<C-E>` keybindings to select entire line for the input component by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2439\r\n* fix: reserve a hack for Zellij to force an image adapter by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2441\r\n* feat: new `rt.term` exports terminal emulator information by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2442\r\n* fix: always show the size in the status bar even in empty directories by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2449\r\n* feat: allow `tab_swap` to cycle tabs by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2456\r\n* feat: support using Yazi in Helix directly without Zellij or tmux by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2461\r\n* refactor: prefer `WriteConsoleW` for Windows console output by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2464\r\n* ci: add label only if not removed manually by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2470\r\n* fix: force ANSI for keyboard progressive enhancement on Windows by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2474\r\n* feat: new `fs.expand_url` API by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2476\r\n* feat!: file navigation wraparound with new `arrow prev` and `arrow next` commands by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2485\r\n* feat!: new `@sync peek` annotation for sync previewers by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2487\r\n* perf: lazy compile and cache lua plugins as binary bytecode by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2490\r\n* feat: new `base` field for the `Url` userdata by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2492\r\n* feat: allow repositioning the cursor in the `rename` DDS event by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2521\r\n* feat: new `symlink_target` to style the target of symbolic links by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2522\r\n* feat: platform-specific key binding by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2526\r\n* feat: show error message when directory fails to load by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2527\r\n* feat: allow bulk renaming to include trailing content in addition to the required new names by @MikuGeek in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2494\r\n* refactor!: remove unnecessary `tasks_show` and `close_input` commands by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2530\r\n* perf!: faster image preview with optimized `magick` arguments by @ze0987 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533\r\n* feat!: support `arrow prev` and `arrow next` for more components by @XOR-op in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2540\r\n* feat: clear terminal before displaying EXIF data by @Integral-Tech in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2541\r\n* feat: new `follow` command to follow files pointed to by symlinks by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2543\r\n* fix: always check whether the cursor exceeds the upper bound to guard against unexpected values by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2551\r\n* feat!: enhance `fzf` integration by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2553\r\n* feat: support Warp terminal image preview by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2571\r\n* feat: allow initializing input when opening it with commands like `rename`, `create`, `find`, `filter`, etc. by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2578\r\n* fix: ignore XQuartz `$DISPLAY` variable by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2586\r\n* fix: don't fail on videos with embedded images by @ze0987 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2590\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @MikuGeek made their first contribution in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2494\r\n* @ze0987 made their first contribution in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/compare/v25.3.2...v25.4.8",
