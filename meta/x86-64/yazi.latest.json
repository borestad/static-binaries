  "body": "## Deprecated\r\n\r\n- `ya.md5()` has been deprecated in favor of the new `ya.hash()`, in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2168\r\n- The plugin entry file `init.lua` has been deprecated in favor of the new `main.lua`, in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2168\r\n- `arrow -99999999` and `arrow 99999999` have been deprecated in favor of the new `arrow top` and `arrow bot`, in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2294\r\n- The `--args` option in the `plugin` command has been deprecated in favor of a new 2nd positional parameter, in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2299\r\n- The numeric return value of the preloader has been deprecated in favor of a new boolean return value, in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2253\r\n\r\n## The [`mount.yazi`](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi) Plugin\r\n\r\nFor a long time, I've been receiving requests from users for a mount manager, but never had the time to finish it. But now — it's here!\r\n\r\n[`mount.yazi`](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi) provides disk mount, unmount, and eject functionality:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b97b8156-e7ca-490c-88a2-8624f4190b29\r\n\r\nDone in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2199.\r\n\r\n## Simplification of `shell` and `plugin` commands\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2298, you can now write shell scripts directly after `--` (end of options marker). Everything after `--` will be treated as raw text, so no more escaping is required, greatly simplifying the writing of complex commands.\r\n\r\nFor example, previously, a simple `echo \"hello 'world'\"` would look like this:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[[manager.prepend_keymap]]\r\non  = \"<C-e>\"\r\nrun = '''\r\n  shell --block 'echo \"hello '\\''world'\\''\"'\r\n'''\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resulted in nested quotes, which was error-prone and unintuitive.\r\n\r\nNow, you can directly include the entire shell script as plain text after `--` without any escaping:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[[manager.prepend_keymap]]\r\non  = \"<C-e>\"\r\nrun = '''\r\n  shell --block -- echo \"hello 'world'\"\r\n'''\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2299, the `plugin` command usage has been simplified as well. For instance:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[[manager.prepend_keymap]]\r\non  = \"<C-e>\"\r\nrun = \"plugin search --args='\\'hello world\\''\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan now be written as:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[[manager.prepend_keymap]]\r\non  = \"<C-e>\"\r\nrun = \"plugin search -- 'hello world'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Replace Mode and Vim Motions (`W`, `E`, `B`, `^`, `_`) for Inputs\r\n\r\nThe Input component now supports replace mode and several new Vim motions, including:\r\n\r\n- `W`: Move forward to the start of the next WORD\r\n- `E`: Move forward to the end of the current or next WORD\r\n- `B`: Move back to the start of the current or previous WORD\r\n- `^`: Move to the first non-whitespace character\r\n- `_`: Move to the first non-whitespace character\r\n\r\nThanks to @dxrcy for the work in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2143!\r\n\r\n## Package Manager Enhancements\r\n\r\nThe package manager now supports the following new features:\r\n\r\n- `ya pack -d` to delete a package (thanks @MrAsler, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2181)\r\n- Support for adding and removing multiple packages with a single command (thanks @evpeople, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2257)\r\n\r\n## Support Local `tmux` Image Preview Over SSH\r\n\r\nNow, when you start tmux locally, connect to a remote SSH session, and run Yazi on the remote host, you'll get image preview support out of the box.\r\n\r\nDone in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2229.\r\n\r\n## New `@since` Plugin Annotation to Specify the Minimum Supported Yazi Version\r\n\r\nYou can now **optionally** specify the minimum supported Yazi version in your plugin:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n--- @since 25.2.7\r\n\r\nreturn {\r\n  entry = function() end\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf specified, and the user's Yazi version is lower than the given version, they will receive an error message preventing the plugin from running accidentally.\r\n\r\nDone in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2290\r\n\r\n## New `ya.confirm()` API\r\n\r\nThe new `ya.confirm()` API allows you to show a confirmation prompt to the user:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal answer = ya.confirm {\r\n  pos = { \"center\", w = 40, h = 10 },\r\n  title = \"Test\",\r\n  content = \"Hello, World!\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also apply a UI element to the title and content to customize the appearance:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal answer = ya.confirm {\r\n  pos = { \"center\", w = 40, h = 10 },\r\n  title = ui.Line(\"Test\"):fg(\"yellow\"):bold(),\r\n  content = ui.Text(\"Hello, World!\"):bg(\"red\"):fg(\"#ffffff\"),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
