  "body": "This is a quick patch release with 3 fixes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where switching directories in Yazi didn't update the CWD, causing issues with features that depend on the CWD (like terminal splitting and `cd --interactive` path completion).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the UI wouldn't refresh when returning to Yazi from an external blocking process (like a shell) while in an empty directory.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the preview wouldn't update after sorting directories when using the [Folder-specific rules](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/tips/#folder-rules) tip.\r\n\r\nHere are some new features:\r\n\r\n- Added support for a large number of new archive formats for extraction, previewing, and filetype highlighting in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/1926 (thanks to @Integral-Tech).\r\n- Added a new temporary option `_v4_suppress_deprecation_warnings` in #2027 to suppress all deprecation warnings as a workaround for the transition to version 0.4:\r\n  ```toml\r\n  # yazi.toml\r\n  [manager]\r\n  _v4_suppress_deprecation_warnings = true\r\n  ```\r\n- Added 2 new Lua APIs\r\n  - `fs.cwd()` - get the current working directory\r\n  -  `fs.create()` - create a directory (Thanks to @hankertrix)\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix: interactive `cd` autocomplete doesn't follow the latest `CWD` changes by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2025\r\n* feat: new option to suppress 0.4 deprecation warnings by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2027\r\n* fix: offset cursor shift when deleting multiple files in bulk by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2030\r\n* chore: bump version to 0.4.2 by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2031\r\n* fix: choose a more conservative `macro_workers` value to ensure concurrency safety with certain USB flash drives by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2040\r\n* feat: support for Android platform in the `for` qualifier of opener by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2041\r\n* fix: set the current working directory in a thread-safe way by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2043\r\n* fix: `allow-passthrough` must be set to `on` to prevent `tmux` from forwarding the real terminal's response to the inactive pane by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2052\r\n* fix: pass through `show_hidden` when building default `Files` by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2057\r\n* fix: use a less intrusive `DSR` instead of `DA1` workaround to forward terminal responses twice in `tmux` by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2058\r\n* feat: new `--cwd` parameter for the `shell` command and `fs.cwd()` API by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2060\r\n* feat: allow `noop` for single-key chords by removing the mixing length limit by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2064\r\n* ci: add riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu target by @Integral-Tech in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2067\r\n* fix: missing a render after resuming from an external blocking process by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2071\r\n* feat: add more supported archive formats to the preset config by @Integral-Tech in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/1926\r\n* feat: new `fs.create()` Lua API by @hankertrix in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2068\r\n* fix: missing a hover after reordering from an external plugin by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2072\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2",
