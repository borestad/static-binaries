  "body": "## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- The `[completion]` component has been renamed to `[cmp]`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2399\r\n\r\n## Deprecated\r\n\r\n- `MANAGER`, `PREVIEW`, `PLUGIN`, and `THEME` have been deprecated in favor of the new `rt` and `th`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2389\r\n- `ya.manager_emit()` has been deprecated in favor of the new `ya.mgr_emit()`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2397\r\n\r\n## Built-in Previewer Improvements\r\n\r\n- The JSON previewer will now respect the user's `wrap` setting to support automatic JSON line wrapping. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2337, thanks @boydaihungst\r\n- The PDF previewer will now respect the user's `max_width` setting to address the issue of previewing content that is too small. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2331\r\n- The ImageMagick previewer will now respect the user's `image_alloc` setting to limit memory usage. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2403\r\n\r\n## New Search Engine: [`rga`](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2383 (thanks @paperbenni) has added a new [`ripgrep-all`](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) search engine.\r\n\r\nIt is a wrapper around `ripgrep` that supports additional file formats (such as PDF, docx, epub, etc.). \r\n\r\nYou can use it with the `search --via=rga` command.\r\n\r\n## Allow to Specify Layer for Keymap Commands\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2399, you'll now be able to assign commands from different layers to a keybinding in `keymap.toml`.\r\n\r\nThis opens up the possibility of interacting with any other component, such as accessing commands from the manager (`[manager]`) within the input component (`[input]`):\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[[input.prepend_keymap]]\r\non   = \"<Esc>\"\r\nrun  = [ \"close\", \"mgr:escape --filter\" ]\r\ndesc = \"Close input and cancel the filter\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you press `Esc` in the input box to exit the filter view (triggered by the `f` key), the filter will be canceled as the input is closed.\r\n\r\n## More Flexible Status Bar Customization\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2313 (thanks @PFiS1737) introduces `sep_left` and `sep_right` to replace the previous `separator_open` and `separator_close` settings, allowing
