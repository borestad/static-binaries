  "body": "This version brings multiplexing to the next level with new user-facing features. It also includes a brand new theme definition spec and some more goodies.\r\nRead all about it in [the official release post](https://zellij.dev/news/stacked-resize-pinned-panes/).\r\n\r\n## Stacked Resize\r\nThis version of Zellij introduces an innovative new way of managing multiple panes. When resizing panes, Zellij will attempt to stack them with their neighbors - giving us more space on screen while still keeping the title of the other panes around so that we can easily navigate to them with the keyboard or mouse.\r\nThis behavior can be disabled through [configuration](https://zellij.dev/documentation/options.html#stacked_resize)\r\n\r\n## Pinned Floating Panes\r\nOne of the most loved features of Zellij is its native integration of floating panes. This version adds the ability to “pin” any such pane so that it is always on top, even when not focused. Floating panes can be pinned with a mouse click or with a keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl p` + `i`.\r\n\r\n## New Theme Definition Spec\r\nThis version introduces a new theme definition specification, allowing much greater flexibility when defining the Zellij UI appearance - extending to user plugins as well. This specification concentrates on the generic UI components used to make-up the Zellij UI rather than mapping colors. We look forward to seeing new themes created by the community with these capabilities.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see [the new theme documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/themes.html)\r\n\r\n## New (Rust) Plugin APIs\r\nThis version adds lots of new capabilities to plugins and exposes them in the built-in Rust SDK. Some highlights:\r\n    * Change the `/host` folder at runtime\r\n    * Change floating pane coordinates\r\n    * Stack arbitrary panes\r\n    * Read mouse motions\r\n\r\n## Double/Triple Mouse Click Text Selection in Terminals\r\nSince Zellij implements its own mouse selection and copying, many users have noted the lack of ability to double or triple click text in order to mark the word boundaries or canonical line respectively. This version implements this capability for terminal panes. Upcoming in the next version is the ability for plugins to opt-in to text marking with the keyboard/mouse on all or parts of their scrollback.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes and Tips on Startup\r\nStarting this version, on first run Zellij will display the release notes for the current version. On subsequent runs, Zellij will display a random useful usage tip on startup. It’s possible to disable both of these behaviors through the config (and in the case of tips, also at runtime through the tips window as specified). More info [here](https://zellij.dev/documentation/options.html#show_release_nodes) and [here](https://zellij.dev/documentation/options.html#show_startup_tips).\r\n\r\nBoth of these can be browsed through the new about plugin with `Ctrl o` + `a`.\r\n\r\n## Do you like Zellij? ❤️\r\nMe too! So much so that I spend 100% of my time developing and maintaining it and have no other income.\r\n\r\nZellij will always be free and open-source. Zellij will never contain ads or collect your data.\r\n\r\nSo if the tool gives you value and you are able, please consider [a recurring monthly donation](https://github.com/sponsors/imsnif) of 5-10$ to help me pay my bills. There are Zellij stickers in it for you!\r\n",
